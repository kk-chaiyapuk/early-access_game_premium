great! 6 turn card battler that doesn't take up to much time and fun to find different ways to win with deck combos. The reason why it's a 2 is because being able to unlock cards and get tokens for the token shop are ridiculous hard. Unless you played the game at launch I feel like you are screwed and it takes to long to get new cards. The spotlight caches are awful. Work your way up to one just to get a small amount of tokens or a variant that we don't need\",\n","  'Great game, but animations can take years to resolve. It is normally fine, but it is a huge pain at the end of the game when you wait for a billion things to resolve. Not being able to retreat in order to cancel the animations is probably the worst feeling in the game (besides losing to Alioth)',\n","  \"I'm enjoying the game a lot. Fast paced and easy to learn. Great time killer. My only gripe is that it just doesn't feel very rewarding. It's not pay to win, but without real money, the fake money never lasts because upgrades are so expensive. If there were other options in shop, like weekly random card bundles you can purchase with just the basic credits and maybe a gold tier, I feel like that would be a great improvement. And card copies from bundles could be exchanged for upgrade pts.\",\n","  \"I have put a lot of time into this game It is fun in short bursts, but the overall monetization that always keeps you feeling left behind unless you keep pumping money in is a problem. The rewards aren't worth it and the climb is unnecessarily frustrating at times to get the meager offerings in ether mode. It's fun in small bursts, but I don't recommend putting anything serious into this game. If you play for Rank, card collection, or just fun decks for your style, it will not be fun.\",\n","  \"I love this game and play it a lot but as of lately, the bugs have been terrible. Cards disappear when building a deck. Random crashes and glitches. Everything was smooth up until recently. I have to play on PC for a decent experience. Mobile version is a bit horrible right now and I'm using my pixel 7.\",\n","  'I love the game. The idea of variations on artwork being the bonus material rather than impossible to beat, super powerful stuff that only a select few can get their hands on like on other games is a nice change of pace. Three new cards a month, not too many. Not too few. No one card is making the game impossible to play. I only play casually and it allows for enjoyment for casual players which I like.',\n","  \"It's fun, and the artwork is great. Reminds me of collecting Marvel cards back in the 90s, but without the Lore. I'd like to be able to turn over the cards and read a bit of the characters' history, a note on their powers, first appearances, memorable fights, killer one_liners etc.. This game is good, but it could do more.\",\n","  \"Started off a great game, seemed like it was play required to get cards. So play to win, not pay to win. But every patch the collection has gotten harder, in order to, I assume, make it harder to get cards without paying money. Maybe if they change it I'll change my review back to 5 star. EDIT: They made it easier to aquire cards in a way, but also a bit more random which cards you get. So I raised my score a bit.\",\n","  \"The quick aspect of the game is where this shines. You can have a fun match in under 3 mins and don't have to spend more time. The team puts in a ton of work to make the current game fun and interesting. With constant new cards and the ability to choose some of the new cards, you will have new experiences. The free to play aspect is decent, which is uncommon in other games. If you buy the season pass, you will not miss out on any game play compared to one that spends a ton.\",\n","  \"It feels bad to spend money and in-game resources because the reward system is too cheap and random and full of stuff you don't really want. It feels bad when you don't because you get the feeling you are missing out or falling behind. The rest of the game is great. Just fix this, please. Update the economy continues to be awful. In fact changes intended to fix it made it worse. Dropping to two stars.\",\n","  \"7/17/23: I've been playing this game for quite some time and am disappointed in the changes that were made to put the dollar first. With the latest update, it feels like getting resources to get new cards/variants has been nerfed so badly that it makes me not want to play the game. Once Second Dinner figures out the in game economy it will be an excellent game. 8/16/23: The Marvel Snap economy is still in shambles.\",\n","  \"the gameplay loop is simple to learn. hard to master. it's luck of the draw when it comes to location boosts. but if you can learn and finagle your deck to the right way ... you can win pretty fast/easy if you're lucky enough. no real need to buy anything. the level up system is plain and simple. the artwork and special cards can make any collector blush. out of all the card games on mobile. this game HAS to be a 5 star. only downside is how addictive it can be to win and build strong decks. 🤙\",\n","  'Good game but touch implementation is horrible. You can inadvertently pass the turn or end up doing something you didn\\'t want to do just because this game doesn\\'t stop you from starting 2 commands at the same time. Let\\'s say you\\'re dragging one card from your hand to the board and while doing so your thumb also touches the end turn button (big and on the down right side, so easy to touch) you\\'ll end up wasting the \"energy\" because the game takes that as a separate input and ends your turn...',\n","  \"The game is fun don't get me wrong but the progression system is very slow. Additionally, the bundles are so pricey! Now the game shutting down which you need to be aware of. When you're playing it just quits the whole game and you have to login from the beginning. This is becoming a habitual problem especially at the end of the season.\",\n","  \"Amazing visuals and audio. Gameplay is fun and pretty light-hearted. Casual nature of the game is great but it needs a single-player mode. After a certain point in matchmaking nearly EVERY game ends in a retreat making the time spent and build up of the match worthless -- I'd recommend this game mostly as a card collector -- Previous upgrades selection would be great, some of the upgrade effects feel like a punishment (foil upgrades) -- Update: -2☆ move towards esports - less fun for casual play\",\n","  \"Having poured hours into this game, I can tell you it is a fun and competitive, when it works. There are too many instances when I'll be playing playing and the screen blacks out, the prompts get misplaced on the screen, the game seemingly just crashes during matches, and sometimes it'll just freeze for no reason. I would like to rate it higher, but these bugs really intrude on my gameplay and are becoming more and more common. If this is resolved, it could be rated higher.\",\n","  \"I love this game. I've played and paid for season passes (and occasional bundles) for the last 6 months. The spotlight cache system has completely destroyed any drive I had to play this game or support it financially. They've completely gutted the main form of progression in the game in favor of an abysmally bad loot box system and seem to ignore the communities cries to adjust it. Unless things change, I don't recommend investing your time or money into this game.\",\n","  'I loved this game, one of the most fun card games I\\'ve played in a long time. Matches are fast and decks are easy to build. The main reason I can\\'t recommend this game anymore is the card aquisiton system. I\\'ve never seen a card game make it so difficult to get new cards. Every time the developer \"fixed\" it they made it significantly worse and less player friendly. The new system encourages hoarding and makes rewards feel terrible.',\n","  \"Very free to play friendly, easy to learn, and awesome art. Would love to give it five stars, but after the last update and the change to collector caches, I have to bump it down to 2. It's a bummer because the new spotlight system is awesome, but the change to reserves was just unneeded and comes off as scummy. The shop and bundles could also use some work I want to spend money on this game, but the system for it sucks.\",\n","  'The new \"Spotlight Cache\" system is just awful. For new players it gives you more cards, but straps the ability to pick which cards you want. For veteran players it\\'s just plain bad. You basically get 1/week and if you get unlucky and pull a duplicate then you\\'re stuck with nothing of value at all. It\\'s lead to hoarding of caches to an extreme degree (people are currently sitting on their rewards waiting for September. 2 full months away!).',\n","  'Love this game, but so many bugs. Including whenever you try submitting a bug on the game it won\\'t let you. Whenever I go to load into a game it completely blacks out the screen and sometimes kicks me from the game entirely. Whenever I tried to report IronFist was bugged when using him, it wouldn\\'t let me submit the bug report in the settings. Also, wish they\\'d move the \"end turn\" button or make it to where to have to hold it to end the turn. Being right handed, I\\'ve missed clicked it a lot.',\n","  \"I've played a ton of this game and used to recommend it to friends, but the constant changes to the system, ever increasing cost and reduction in value, lack of clear communication, and now the awful experience I'm having with Spotlight caches has got me giving this a 1-star review. Get it together, find some leadership, vision, and product direction! Customer interviews and journey maps. If the intent is to nickel and dime this game isn't going to have longevity and you're losing a lot of trust\",\n","  \"It used to be a very good and fun game. Now, there are game bugs every patch without fail and some don't even get fixed months after. What's worse, though, is how expensive it has become. Card acquisition has become so terrible that getting the card you want would take months to save up for (unless they randomly decide to put them inside a spotlight cache). If they spent as much time making the game better as they spend designing new ways to nickel and dime you, it would be a great game.\",\n","  \"Extremely fun game if you've been playing for months and have a near complete collection of cards, have a bunch of currency saved up from when the loot boxes were more generous, and enjoy fast paced games(3minute matches). With the new loot box system it's impossible for new players to keep up. No QA, every new card which has a unique ability or new feature will almost for sure be bugged. One of the better CCG/mobile games, just impossible to recommend to new players without changes.\",\n","  \"A game that doesn't want to be played. Played the game for a couple of months, and the longer I played, the more annoying the game became. You spend the time to build a deck with a limited number of cards, and then the game will give you locations that prevent you from playing them altogether. The higher your rank becomes, the less playable the game is, meaning quiting the gane, retreating, is the best option. Eventually I was stuck in a reconnecting to game loop. Rendering it unplayable.\",\n","  'I started playing at release in October. The cards are separated into 5 Series. Series 1 and 2 feels really good to play and collect. Series 3 is an absolute slog to get through and feels the worst to enter. Series 4 and 5 cards were easy enough to buy and save for once; but Second Diner has once again made changes that benefits their pockets and hurts players. The goal of this game is to never have a complete collection which makes being competitive exhausting, frustrating, or impossible.',\n","  'As someone with hundred of hours, has spent a fair bit on the game, and reached infinite every season since ive been playing, i wouldnt recommend this game to new players. The recent changes feel terrible once you get past the inital stages of the game. 0 competitive integrity as Second Dinner refuses to make separate location listings for ladder and casual modes. Extremely greedy devs, absolutely ruined the game systems and my experience. The art in the game is great though XD',\n","  \"I think this is a brilliant game but a few technical and monetary issues keep it from being a 5. There are bugs and menu issues that are annoying but not game breaking. However, the items for sale with real money are an absolute joke. They ask you to pay the cost of a full game to get two variants and some resources. That's embarrassing to look at. Outside of season passes gathering credits is brutally hard. They do so much right with progression and aesthetic cleverness but the greed kills.\",\n","  'Game could be fun but it definitely plays very unfairly most times. Certain players seem to have better \"luck\" because it\\'s starting to get overrun by AI. The game is based around things being random but the outcome isn\\'t. AI always have exactly perfect cards and you\\'ll lose the maximum points too... I have uninstalled the Game, absolutely don\\'t recommend. I love a challenge but it\\'s just a frustrating waste of time and has become no longer even close to fun. Lastly for the record I wasn\\'t a F2P',\n","  \"Very fun, played many card games and this is more along a puzzle. Worth a try, hasn't gotten stale for me, but seems like it can with how short games play out. Edit: from 4 stars to 1 after 9 months of play. Second Dinner has gotten more greedy and bold with their choice of how to extort players of money. Aside from paying money, the model of earning cards has gotten worse and less friendly. Until changes are made I'd stay away. A great game is hidden underneath the pile of rubbish choices.\",\n","  'It is a fun idea. Love anything Marvel. Art is nice. Big problem is the game crashes ... A LOT! Also a little hard to play. Between the changes that can happen each match with the levels and cards played on both sides. It could be a lot better but I see it losing interest quickly with players for FAR better games in the Marvel sector or other areas.',\n","  \"The other reviews below paint a decent picture. I've been playing since release and the game has slowly improved, but definitely become more predatory in acquisition terms. Systems came and go as the developers find their monetization curve, much to the chagrin of the player base. Now this game is more of a never-ending gacha grind to get the new cards and complete a collection, which is an impossible task given the new updates. Prior, I'd recommend it, but now just be a Free-2-play for sanity.\",\n","  \"Changes to card acquisition is rough. The gameplay is great and honestly very fun. The recent changes to the in game caches has made it more difficult to acquire cards (from decrease in token acquisition, removal of cards from standard caches, and the removal of gold) and has totally removed all incentives to open caches at all. Hopefully they can listen to the player based and turn the ship back in the right direction. Don't download until they fix the card acquisition system.\",\n","  'Unlock duplicate cards to convert for fewer tokens. Garbage return rate. What\\'s the point of grinding to get higher levels to get collector\\'s reserve if there are gonna be duplicates? Started out as a good game without too much pay to win. Now, just like all the other money grab games. \"you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain\"',\n","  'Since last week, the game is extremely sluggish and unresponsive. It seems like the loading of images/vfx is done on the main thread, as whenever a new card/vfx appears on the screen, the game gets fully stuck, and is resumed after several seconds (when the asset is fully loaded). I am not sure whether this started happening after updating to the latest version or when I upgraded to Android 14. Please have a look at this, it makes the game almost unplayable.',\n","  \"Certainly addicting, and you won't need to pay anything if you have a deck based on your playstyle and play the cards right. It really doesn't matter if your opponent has a better deck than you, you just need play smart. One bug I face is when I started an Ultimate Conquest, searched for a game, and when it took too long, I cancelled and upgraded my deck, only to find out it entered the game and retreated, i lost the ticket, so... One recc. is to make it 7 rounds, instead of it as a location.\",\n","  \"Pay to win. The pace of progress is deliberately slowed to about a tenth of what it should be. New game-changing cards come out every season and unless you play for months and get lucky, you need to spend money. This isn't just for cosmetics (which can cost more than 20 dollars for a single card). There are two deals on the store right now that cost 100 dollars each. Once you get a decent collection of cards, it gets pretty boring, so I get why they slow it down so much.\",\n","  \"Was asked to make my account safe to avoid losing progress and purchases, so connected to my google account. Few hours later, I start the game up again. Asked to log on, as it failed to do so automatically, and everything has been reset. All progress and purchase gone. Don't waste your time, when you could(apparently) at any time lose all the progress you've made. Uninstalled it myself after a few failed attempts at fixing the problem, which imo is too bad, because I was quite enjoying it.\",\n","  \"TL;DR: if you wanna play for free, don't join now. It's a cool game but it's not fun at all. After 5 months of playing and even one season pass purchased, I'm considering deleting it. The collector's cache system makes it so slow to grow unless you consider spending hundreds of bucks a month, so it's nearly impossible to compete. The matching system is also pretty bad.\",\n","  \"I play this game more than any other mobile game, by a significant amount. It's deep and the meta is generally balanced and fun. The variants are cool and fun to pursue. The only reason I'm knocking it down a point is because of recent changes that have made it harder to gain gold and tokens, despite the insane amount of content that whales can spend money on.
